# Aim of the project
The goal of this repository is to allow interested readers to reproduce the results of my thesis and to experiment with different hyperparameters. Note that the
code is not particularly written with the goal of reuseability for other projects in mind. That being said, the code is documented and should be understandable. 

My thesis can be found here: [Lenient Similarity Learning for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://scripties.uba.uva.nl/search?id=716643) 
and extends [Lenient learning](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/2946645.3007037) with a similarity metric which was introduced by a paper called
[Likelihood Quantile Networks for Coordinating Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://ifaamas.org/Proceedings/aamas2020/pdfs/p798.pdf). 

The rough outline of my thesis is that I explain why a similarity metric is useful and compare different similarity in their effectiveness. Next, I incorporate the 
similarity metric into lenient learning and compare it with the version without a similarity metric. Additionally, I also show in which setting the similarity 
metric can fail and finally compare lenient similarity learning with different similarity metrics.
